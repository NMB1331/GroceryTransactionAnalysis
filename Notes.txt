Things to do:
- Test how well the current growth code will scale (memory will probably be the bottleneck)
- Market Basket Analysis (items commonly purchased together)
- Volume trends (patterns in high volume of sales) (think scheduling- when are we busy, when are we not?)
- Alternating Least Squares (predict what customers will purchase based on past purchases)
